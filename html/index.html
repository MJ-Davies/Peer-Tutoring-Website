                            As high school opens up a new avenue full of opportunity, John Knox’s Peer Tutoring program offers students young and old an excellent chance to collectively nurture their academic prowess. As a senior student looking for a rewarding volunteer experience, this program allowed me to develop my interpersonal skills all the while breaking down the walls that separated senior and junior students. Not only was I able to gain valuable experience as a tutor, but as a previous student in their positions, I could also share insight on the tips and tricks that could bring about success in each of their own classes. All in all, John Knox’s Peer Tutoring program is an extremely rewarding job and an excellent way to get involved within the school and the student body.

It also allows both the teaching skills of the tutors and the understanding of educational concepts of the tutees to flourish. I will continue to benefit and grow from my involvement in this initiative and I hope that it will continue to be present in the future as an asset to coming students.

                            My experience with Peer Tutoring was an online-based system that allowed me to connect with the younger students in a covid-safe way. I was impressed with the efficiency and thoughtfulness of this system which allowed interaction across different grades while keeping everyone comfortable. I chose to offer guidance in math and English and had two students (grade 8 and grade 10). I really enjoyed tutoring, as I also felt proud of the progress that my tutees made and I hope that my guidance allowed them to feel inspired to continue to be even better.

                            When I was struggling to keep my grades afloat, the Peer Tutoring service lended a helping hand. I was paired with Krystal Herfst, a student in Grade 12, who had the ability to connect with me on a personal level - and more importantly, understood my strive to work harder everyday. I sought help in Math & Science and my tutor had gone above and beyond for each lesson. The Peer Tutoring service offers the best tutoring service for any academic area, while also being able to bond with other students.

                            Peer Tutoring really helped me during the year. Before joining the program, I had difficulties with math and I struggled with being confident when it came to homework, tests and exams. Once I entered the program, I was immediately introduced to a lovely tutor who helped me understand the concepts I had trouble comprehending. I recommend this program to anyone who is having trouble with any subject.

                            Coming into high school this year, I was a little worried about how the seniors would treat us. In many movies, grade 12s take the role of the bully, so I didn’t really know what to expect. Nevertheless, when the sign up for the Peer Tutoring went up, I decided to give it a try. I soon found out that it is actually quite fun! My tutor, Blake, was great! He helped me raise my grades and understand more things at school. I also liked Peer Tutoring because Blake and I, being closer in age, share some of the same interests, making it easy to talk to him. Overall, I think that I will keep signing up for Peer Tutoring. I highly suggest it to anyone who is getting grades that they are not content with to sign up too.

I’d never tutored or been tutored before and honestly didn’t know what to expect, but I am really happy meeting with Cameron every week. We get along really well and have similar interests and plenty of things to talk about. We usually work on his homework together, and I am able to help him with concepts he doesn’t understand. Even if he doesn’t have any homework , we still meet up and hang out, watching funny YouTube videos, or just chill. Overall, my Peer Tutoring experience has been a lot of fun even for me, and I look forward to connecting with Cameron every week.

The program has made a positive impact on student learning across all grades and all core subjects at the high school. I love the fact that students have flexibility in setting up tutoring schedules, including a walk-in tutoring option. What a beneficial program that mutually blesses the tutor, the tutee, and our school community.
